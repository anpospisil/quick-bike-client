## Introduction

Hello There! My name is Andrew. This is my portfolio project named 'Quick Bike'. Please, keep in mind that this is a MVP, not a final version. You can check out my "To Do" list [here](https://github.com/users/anpospisil/projects/1) to see the progress I've made and features that will be added in future.


## The Concept

This main idea of this project is to create a web-based app for short-term bike rental. Users can create an account, reserve a bike using a map interface and lock/unlock their bike in-app.

‚≠êÔ∏è New technologies learned during this project.

## Goals of this project

The goal of this project is to build a full-stack app using knowledge gained during the bootcamp and incorporating new technologies learned using official documentations and googling.

- Practice full-stack development
- Apply knowledge gained from the bootcamp
- Learn and Apply new technology independently
- Showcase development process through wireframes, user stories and UML
- Practice proper commits & branching on github

## User Stories

- User Stories

  - As a person taking a day trip to a large city, I want to reserve a bike for the day.
  - As a person who doesn‚Äôt memorize addresses, I would like to view available bikes on a map depending on the postal code I input, so I don‚Äôt have to spend a lot of time searching for bikes.
  - As someone who loses things easily, I want a simple way to unlock/lock my Quick Bike from the App so I don‚Äôt have to fiddle with keys or locking mechanisms.
  - As a person who values their privacy and security, I want to have a dedicated profile that requires login info so that only I can see my trip and payment info.
  - As a cost-conscious user of Quick Bike, I want to see my invoices organized by week, month and year so I can budget accordingly and have a record for tax purposes.

  This mvp is still a work in progress. Some features still need to be implemented and revised.

## Git Workflow

In this project I try to:

- Use descriptive commit messages
- Name branches according to feature
- Commit frequently
- Push features to development rather than master
